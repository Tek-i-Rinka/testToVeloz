For the mockup, my goal is to implement it in a pixel-perfect manner.

After completing the mockup above, we ask that you add the following functionality in JavaScript, JQuery, or the JS framework of your choosing:

-   Problem 1a: After the page finishes loading, fade images on the page to 60% brightness. When mousing over an image bring it to full brightness. When mousing off the image return to dim.

-   Problem 1b: When a user clicks on a text block, store the "click count" in a cookie. On every 5th click, show an alert stating that they clicked the text every 5 times.

-   Problem 1c: When a user clicks on an image, store the "click count" in a JSON object in localStorage. This object should store the names of all images and how many times each was clicked.

-   Problem 1d: Add a new button which shows a popup "carousel slider" which lets users scroll between all images. Each image should show the click count as a caption based on localStorage in Problem 1c.
